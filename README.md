## Project description

The dataset contains data for several penguins belonging to 3 different species, othe goal will be to produce a model able **to classify the penguins into three different species**. 

In this notebook we will first focus on **data description** to get a first overview of our data. From there, we will proceed with **feature selection** *- that is to choose which features to keep or not -* and we will **clean the data** to make our data exploitable. Then, we will focus on **data exploration and visualization** in order to understand better the data we will have to analyze. The last step before starting the model building is to **encode and to normalize the data**. 

Regarding the modeling part, we **test and compare** different machine learning classification techniques in order to choose one to produce a classifier model able to predict to which specie a penguin belongs based on its characteristics.
